# Timed-Code-Quiz READ ME

i really had a tough time with this one obviously.
i got help from many people but and i was able to apply
what i wanted to do for the first question and kind of the point system
but i couldnt figure out how to apply for the next set of questions.
i will try to revisit this homework one day. but i spent close to the 20 hours on
this HW and i think its time to move on and revisit at a later date with more knowledge!!!

and suggestions to this would go a long way. but
thanks
